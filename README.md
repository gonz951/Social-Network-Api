## Description

This project was made as a way to figure out NoSQL, routing, etc. in its most basic form. It's simply a responsive backend with no front end to interact with, but it's crucial for figuring out backends in the future.

## Installation and Usage

The project can be used through these files with a simple 'npm i' and 'npm start'. Unfortunately, the seeding doesn't work, but if you don't want to do everything manually, here's a small video on everything that currently works: [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Ld7VoUuLVGvdAOieyi4EUIXebh4eSHu6/view)
